* Building and Installing 

  1. Install a recent version of Erlang.
  2. make
  3. make install with Environment variables for configuration.
     TARGET_DIR: Installation target directory.
     SBIN_DIR: sbin direcotry.

     e.g.
       TARGET_DIR=/user/local/mio SBIN_DIR=/usr/sbin/ make install 

* Running Mio
Invoke the mio shell script.
To shut down the mio just terminate the process. Alternatively, use the mioctl stop command.

You can also start the server in "detached" mode with mio -detached, in which case the server process is backgrounded immediately and nothing is written to the console.

* Logging
If -l <log_dir> has not been specified, the default is the current directory.
